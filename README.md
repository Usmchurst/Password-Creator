## Inputs for password Generation

I created else if statements to ensure the generator functions correctly when the prompts ask questions.

I also created variables so the data can be selected for the generator at random. 

Updated password generator to start when the password button is clicked.

When the character number is selected the password is generated and undefined is not present the second tim around.
